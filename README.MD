plam recognition implementation for paper:

You can assume that all the normalized/segmented images are now provided to you (in the following). I¡°only¡± show one ROC using the

 method shown in Figure 15 of this paper, i.e., just implement ¡°original + location¡± method and do NOT generate ROC using

 DoG or location or orginal method.

You can get all the segmented/enhanced palmprint images for this database (IITDR) from the weblink in the following.

My work is to plot Receiver Operating Characteristics for the matching performance using IITDR database. The ROC plot 

will require you to generate 1150 genuine scores (230*10) and 1316750 impostor scores from the 1150 images available in the database.

You can download the segmented and normalized IITDR palmprint database for this problem from the following link. Therefore you do 

not need to do any image processing operations and can just use the segmented images that you can download from the following webs.
